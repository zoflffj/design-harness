## Overview

Huddling (허들링) is an AI practice lab and asset library — learning materials, skill/prompt cards, and member-made assets — and its own interface is engineered to get out of the way. The system is strictly monochrome: near-black ink (`{colors.ink}` — #141414) on a pure white canvas (`{colors.canvas}`), with structure carried by a ladder of barely-perceptible neutral tints rather than by shadows or color. The learning content, skill cards, example outputs, and member assets the app exists to show are the only saturated elements on any page — the chrome frames them the way a gallery wall frames paintings.

The geometry does the brand work that color refuses to do. Every interactive element is a stadium pill (`{rounded.full}`): the floating navigation bar, every button, the segmented billing toggle, the overlay badges. Containers sit at a calm `{rounded.md}` (24px), media tiles at `{rounded.sm}` (16px), and app icons render as iOS-style squircles at 30% corner radius. Type is set in Pretendard with strong weight contrast — Bold 700 for every heading, Regular 400 for text, Light 300 for lead subtitles — which gives the monochrome pages a strong typographic voice without a single decorative flourish.

One color is allowed to interrupt: an electric blue accent (`{colors.accent}` — #0066ff), used exclusively for commercial signals — the "Popular" plan badge and the yearly-savings callout on pricing. Its scarcity is the point; when blue appears, it is asking for a decision.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Gallery-white monochrome palette — `{colors.ink}` on `{colors.canvas}`, zero brand chroma outside the single `{colors.accent}` blue
- Stadium-pill interaction language: nav bar, buttons, toggles, and badges all at `{rounded.full}`
- Shadow-free elevation — hierarchy built from a neutral tint ladder (`{colors.canvas-soft}`, `{colors.field}`, `{colors.hairline}`) and 1px hairlines
- Pretendard with weight contrast: 700 headings at 1.3–1.35 line-height, 400 body at 1.5, 300 light subtitles
- iOS-style squircle icon tiles (30% radius) as a recurring visual motif across library counters and brand marquees
- Content supplies the color: app screenshots, brand icons, and grayscale curator portraits carry all visual richness
- Full-bleed near-black `{colors.ink}` footer with rounded top corners closes every page in polarity inversion

## Colors

Source pages: home, pricing, awards, signup.

### Brand & Accent

- **Ink Black** (`{colors.primary}` — #141414): The brand color. Fills every primary CTA pill, the footer band, and all display typography. Huddling's identity is this near-black, softened just off pure black to sit comfortably next to photography.
- **Electric Blue** (`{colors.accent}` — #0066ff): The only chromatic accent in the system. Reserved for commercial emphasis — the "Popular" pricing badge and savings callouts. Never used decoratively, never used for CTAs.

### Surface

- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` — #ffffff): Default page and card background across all pages.
- **Soft Canvas** (`{colors.canvas-soft}` — #f3f3f3): The workhorse tint — a 6% ink wash over white. Fills the floating nav pill, the featured pricing card, FAQ accordion rows, soft utility pills, segmented-control tracks, and the highlighted comparison-table column.
- **Field** (`{colors.field}` — #f0f0f0): An 8% ink wash used as the fill for form inputs, giving fields presence without borders.
- **Soft Hairline** (`{colors.hairline-soft}` — #f0f0f0): 1px card outlines — the faintest possible edge, used on white-on-white cards (pricing, testimonials).
- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` — #e0e0e0): The stronger 16% control border, used on outlined pill buttons and interactive chrome.

### Text

- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` — #141414): Headings, body copy, and nav links.
- **Soft Ink** (`{colors.ink-soft}` — #262626): Slightly lifted dark used for secondary lockups and the awards wordmark.
- **Muted** (`{colors.text-muted}` — #707070): Secondary copy — supporting paragraphs, plan descriptions, vote counts, underlined inline links.
- **Faint** (`{colors.text-faint}` — #adadad): Tertiary text — placeholders, de-emphasized footer links, fine print.

### Semantic

- The system ships no dedicated success/warning/error palette on its marketing surfaces; state communication stays within the monochrome ladder, with `{colors.accent}` as the sole positive-emphasis signal.

## Typography

### Font Family

**Pretendard** — a Korean–Latin neo-grotesque used exclusively, across every screen and every role. On the web it is loaded as **Pretendard Variable**; in Figma use the static weights (Light 300 · Regular 400 · SemiBold 600 · Bold 700). The brand's voice comes from weight contrast: headings at Bold 700, running text at Regular 400, and lead subtitles at a light 300. Fallback stack: `-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Apple SD Gothic Neo", "Noto Sans KR", sans-serif`.

Sizes below are set for the mobile baseline frame (390×844). Korean glyphs need more vertical room than Latin, so headings sit at 1.3–1.35 and body text at 1.5.

### Hierarchy

| Token                    | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ----------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{typography.display}`   | 32px | 700    | 1.3         | 0              | Home hero statements and key counters                    |
| `{typography.heading-1}` | 28px | 700    | 1.3         | 0              | Screen titles                                            |

| `{typography.body-lg}`   | 17px | 300    | 1.5         | 0              | Lead paragraphs — the light counterpoint to 700 headings |
| `{typography.body}`      | 15px | 400    | 1.5         | 0              | Default body copy                                        |
| `{typography.body-sm}`   | 13px | 400    | 1.5         | 0              | Supporting copy, feature lists, legal text               |
| `{typography.link}`      | 15px | 600    | 1.5         | 0              | Nav links and button labels                              |
| `{typography.label}`     | 12px | 600    | 1.4         | 0              | Badge and pill labels                                    |
| `{typography.caption}`   | 12px | 400    | 1.4         | 0              | Captions, metadata, form fine print                      |

### Principles

- **Weight contrast is the drama.** Pairing 700 headings against 300 light subtitles (e.g. 32px display over 17px light lead) creates hierarchy without color or ornament.
- **Controlled leading.** Headings sit at 1.3–1.35 — tight, but with enough room for Korean glyphs. Body text opens up to 1.5.
- **Zero letter-spacing everywhere.** Pretendard is trusted at its natural fit; no tracking adjustments at any size.

## Layout

### Spacing System

- **Base unit**: 8px, with 4px half-steps for fine rhythm
- **Tokens**: `{spacing.xxs}` 4px · `{spacing.xs}` 8px · `{spacing.sm}` 12px · `{spacing.md}` 16px · `{spacing.lg}` 24px · `{spacing.xl}` 32px · `{spacing.section}` 48px · `{spacing.section-lg}` 64px
- Buttons are fixed-height pills padded horizontally at `{spacing.md}`; inputs pad `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}`
- Screen side padding is `{spacing.md}` (16px); sections are separated by `{spacing.section}` (48px), and `{spacing.section-lg}` (64px) separates major home-screen acts

### Grid & Container

- Content rides a centered column: single-column centered lockups for heroes and award winners, a 2-up card grid for pricing plans, 3-up for portrait tiles, and a 4-column masonry for testimonials.
- The floating nav pill is detached from the viewport edge and horizontally centered, rather than a full-width bar — the page canvas visibly wraps around it.
- Marquee strips (brand logos, app screenshots) run full-bleed beyond the content column.

### Whitespace Philosophy

Whitespace is the primary grouping device. Sections are separated by `{spacing.section}` to `{spacing.section-lg}` of empty canvas with no divider rules; within cards, generous `{spacing.lg}` padding keeps content off the hairline edges. The homepage alternates dense collage moments (icon clouds, screenshot grids) with near-empty typographic interludes — compression and release.

### Responsive Strategy

#### Screen Size

MVP is designed mobile-first on a single baseline.

| Name             | Width × Height | Notes                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Baseline         | 390 × 844      | Default design frame for all key screens (Figma)             |
| Minimum          | 360px width    | Layouts must hold without horizontal scroll; long text wraps |
| Tablet / Desktop | —              | Out of MVP scope — to be defined after MVP                   |

- Side padding: `{spacing.md}` (16px) on both sides at every width.
- Content is single-column by default; grids collapse to one column at the minimum width.

#### Touch Targets

- Pill buttons and nav CTAs are fixed-height stadium shapes comfortably above the 44px minimum; form inputs pad to a similar height via `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}`.
- The segmented billing toggle presents each option as a full pill target, not a small radio dot.

#### Collapsing Strategy

- The floating `nav-pill` persists on scroll and across breakpoints, tightening to logomark + CTA on narrow screens.
- Multi-column grids (pricing 2-up, portraits 3-up, testimonials 4-up) collapse column-by-column rather than reflowing horizontally.
- The signup page's two-panel split (form left, angled screenshot marquee right) drops the marquee panel entirely on narrow viewports, keeping the centered form column.

#### Image Behavior

- App screenshots and device mockups keep fixed aspect ratios and `{rounded.md}` corners at all sizes.
- Marquee strips overflow the viewport intentionally and animate horizontally; they crop rather than scale.
- Curator portraits stay square-ish tiles, lazily loaded, always grayscale.

## Elevation & Depth

| Level   | Treatment                                       | Use                                                   |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0       | Flat on `{colors.canvas}`                       | Default — most of every page                          |
| 1       | `{colors.canvas-soft}` fill, no border          | Nav pill, featured pricing card, FAQ rows, soft pills |
| 2       | 1px `{colors.hairline-soft}` outline on white   | Pricing and testimonial cards                         |
| 3       | 1px inset ring                                  | Comparison-table highlight column edge                |
| Inverse | `{colors.ink}` fill, `{colors.on-primary}` text | Footer band, primary CTAs                             |

The system is essentially shadow-free: no drop shadows appear on any card, button, or nav element. Elevation is communicated by _fill difference_ (white vs. 6–8% ink tints) and by hairlines, which keeps every surface print-flat and lets the screenshot content supply all depth cues. The one soft-shadow exception is the active segment of the segmented control, which lifts off its `{colors.canvas-soft}` track as a white pill.

### Decorative Depth

- **Glass monoliths** — the awards hero renders tall trophy pillars in a white-to-gray vertical gradient, reading as frosted glass against the `{colors.canvas-soft}` band; the page's only atmospheric gradient.
- **Photography as depth** — floating app-icon squircles, angled screenshot collages (signup's rotated marquee panel), and device mockups create parallax-like layering on a flat canvas.
- **Polarity inversion** — the `{colors.ink}` footer with `{rounded.md}` top corners acts as a heavy baseboard, giving each page a physical end-stop.

## Shapes

### Border Radius Scale

| Token            | Value  | Use                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{rounded.none}` | 0px    | Full-bleed media strips and marquee images                        |
| `{rounded.sm}`   | 16px   | Inputs, video tiles, testimonial cards, FAQ rows                  |
| `{rounded.md}`   | 24px   | Content cards, device mockups, portrait tiles, footer top corners |
| `{rounded.full}` | 9999px | Every pill: nav, buttons, badges, toggles                         |

### Photography Geometry

- App screenshots render inside device-shaped frames at `{rounded.md}`.
- App icons use the signature 30% squircle radius (`app-icon-squircle`) — the iOS icon silhouette — at every size from 32px chips to 96px hero tiles.
- Curator portraits are near-square tiles at `{rounded.md}`, always black-and-white, with name captions overlaid in `{colors.on-primary}` on a `badge-overlay` scrim near the lower edge.
- Avatars in testimonial cards are small circles (`{rounded.full}`) with a tiny company logo badge overlapping the bottom-right corner.

## Components

### Buttons

**`button-primary`** — "Join for free", "Get started", "Continue", "View winners"

- Fill `{colors.primary}`, label `{colors.on-primary}` in `{typography.link}`, shape `{rounded.full}`, padding `0px {spacing.md}` on a fixed-height pill
- The single CTA style everywhere: nav, pricing cards, auth form, awards hero

**`button-outline`** — "Continue with Google", secondary "Get started"

- Fill `{colors.canvas}`, label `{colors.ink}`, 1px `{colors.hairline}` border, shape `{rounded.full}`
- The de-emphasized twin of the primary pill; used when two actions sit side by side or for third-party auth

**`button-pill-soft`** — "Explore ↗", "Huddling ↗", "Read more"

- Fill `{colors.canvas-soft}`, label `{colors.ink}`, shape `{rounded.full}`
- Tertiary utility pill for outbound and in-page links; no border, relies on its tint fill

### Cards & Containers

**`pricing-card`** — default plan tier (Team)

- `{colors.canvas}` fill, 1px `{colors.hairline-soft}` outline, `{rounded.md}` corners
- Plan name in `{typography.heading-4}`, price figure large with stacked `{typography.caption}` qualifiers, feature list rows in `{typography.body-sm}` with `{colors.text-muted}` icons

**`pricing-card-featured`** — highlighted plan tier (Pro)

- `{colors.canvas-soft}` fill, borderless, `{rounded.md}` corners — emphasis by tint, not by outline or polarity flip
- Carries the `badge-popular` chip beside the plan name and a full-width `button-primary` CTA, while the default tier gets `button-outline`

**`testimonial-card`** — user quote tile

- `{colors.canvas}` fill, 1px `{colors.hairline-soft}` outline, `{rounded.sm}` corners
- Circular avatar with overlapping company mini-badge, name in `{typography.link}`, company in `{colors.text-muted}` `{typography.body-sm}`, quote in `{typography.body}`
- Laid out as a 4-column masonry of varying heights

**`faq-row`** — accordion item

- Full-width `{colors.canvas-soft}` bar, `{rounded.sm}` corners, question in `{typography.body}` with a trailing chevron; rows stack with `{spacing.sm}` gaps

**`portrait-tile`** — curator/juror grid cell

- Grayscale photograph at `{rounded.md}`, name + role caption overlaid at bottom center in `{colors.on-primary}`
- The strict black-and-white treatment keeps the people grid inside the monochrome system

### Inputs & Forms

**`text-input`**

- `{colors.field}` fill, no border, `{colors.ink}` text with `{colors.text-faint}` placeholder, `{rounded.sm}` corners, padding `{spacing.sm} {spacing.md}`

**`text-input-focused`**

- Same chrome plus a 2px `{colors.ink}` ring — focus is signaled in ink, consistent with the monochrome system

### Navigation

**`nav-pill`** — Top Nav (Desktop)

- A floating, horizontally-centered stadium bar in `{colors.canvas-soft}`: logomark + wordmark left, text links ("Pricing", "Awards", "Log in") in `{typography.link}` right, capped by a `button-primary` CTA
- Detaches from the page edge with visible canvas above it; persists as a sticky element on scroll

**Top Nav (Mobile)**

- The pill tightens to logomark + CTA; links collapse behind the pill

**Sub-nav (Awards)**

- Minimal corner marks instead of a bar: logomark + section name top-left, a `button-pill-soft` "Huddling ↗" return link top-right

### Signature Components

**`app-icon-squircle`** — the recurring 30%-radius icon tile; floats in loose clouds around library counters, lines up in "Other nominees" rows, and anchors `brand-chip` entries

**`brand-chip`** — marquee lockup of squircle icon + brand name in `{typography.heading-3}` ink; scrolls horizontally in full-bleed strips of recognizable products

**`badge-popular`** — compact `{colors.accent}` chip with `{colors.on-primary}` label marking the featured pricing tier; the only blue element on the page

**`badge-overlay`** — translucent gray pill (rgba(115, 115, 115, 0.56)) with `{colors.on-primary}` `{typography.label}` text, laid over photography and screenshots (category tags, portrait captions)

**`segmented-control`** + **`segmented-control-active`** — billing-period toggle: a `{colors.canvas-soft}` stadium track holding two pill options; the active option is a `{colors.canvas}` white pill, the inactive label sits in `{colors.text-muted}`

**`award-lockup`** — centered winner presentation: laurel-flanked category eyebrow in `{colors.text-muted}`, winner name in `{typography.heading-3}`, description in `{colors.text-muted}` `{typography.body}`, vote share in `{typography.body-sm}`, closed by a `button-pill-soft` "Explore ↗"

**`compare-table`** — the pricing comparison grid: feature rows divided by 1px `{colors.canvas-soft}` rules, the recommended plan's column washed in `{colors.canvas-soft}` with an inset ring edge

**`footer`** — full-width `{colors.ink}` band with `{rounded.md}` top corners: white wordmark at display scale, tagline in `{colors.text-faint}`, two columns of `{colors.text-faint}` links that read in `{colors.on-primary}` for emphasis rows

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Keep the canvas `{colors.canvas}` white and let imported content (screenshots, icons, logos) supply all saturation.
- Use `{rounded.full}` for every interactive element — a rectangular button does not exist in this system.
- Build emphasis with the tint ladder: `{colors.canvas-soft}` fill for featured surfaces, `{colors.hairline-soft}` outlines for resting cards.
- Reserve `{colors.accent}` for commercial signals (featured badges, savings callouts) — one or two blue elements per page at most.
- Set every heading in Pretendard Bold 700 with line-height 1.3–1.35.
- Pair Bold 700 headings with 300-weight `{typography.body-lg}` subtitles for hierarchy without color.
- Render app icons as 30% squircles and portraits in grayscale to keep third-party imagery inside the system.
- Close pages with the inverse `{colors.ink}` footer, rounded at the top.

### Don't

- Don't add drop shadows — elevation is fills and hairlines only.
- Don't use `{colors.accent}` for CTAs; primary actions are always `{colors.primary}` ink pills.
- Don't introduce additional accent hues, gradients on UI chrome, or colored section bands.
- Don't outline the featured pricing tier — feature it with the `{colors.canvas-soft}` fill and `badge-popular` instead.
- Don't apply letter-spacing or all-caps styling; the type system runs at natural tracking in sentence case.
- Don't put borders on form fields at rest — inputs are `{colors.field}` tint fills; the border appears only as the 2px ink focus ring.
- Don't let full-color photography of people into the curator/juror grids; portraits are strictly black-and-white.
- Don't square off pill geometry at small sizes — badges, chips, and toggles stay stadium-shaped.
